Group.Net

A Group Theory Library in C#

Group Theory and Computation Algebra
====================================

Group Theory is part of the wider mathematical discipline of Algebra. If you want to measure and describe the number of occurrences of something, use an integer. If you want to measure and describe the amount of something, use a rational number. If you want to measure and describe the symmetry of a structure, use a group.

Essentially, group theory deals with symmetry - in both real world and hypothetical structures.

Haven't you heard of GAP?
-------------------------

For almost every group theory use case there could possibly be, your first port of call should be the open source programming library <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/">GAP</a>.

Reason for Group.Net
====================

The Group.Net library is written entirely in C# which makes it much more portable and interoperable with Microsoft platforms. It is also open source.

At present it has almost completely without functionality. The only thing it's capable of is calculating the orbit on a set of points under a permutation group.

Everywhere has to start somewhere though.

Future Work
===========

The Orbit-Stabiliser algorithm the most likely next item of functionality. After that there will be variations of Set based implementations to go along with the current Point based one.
